## Introduction

`LeveGL` aims to empower you to build and prototype games quickly. It is a lightweight rendering library written in C99, drawing inspiration from the simplicity of [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and the robustness of [liblava](https://github.com/liblava/liblava). Originally a study project, the focus is on keeping the code clear, simple, and easy to work with.

> _It started as a learning project, but I‚Äôve come to appreciate its simple and practical design, which makes it great for experimenting._

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> `LeveGL` is currently in a highly work-in-progress state. The API is unstable and subject to significant changes. It is intended for learning and experimentation purposes.

To get started with, here's a simple example that demonstrates the basics:

This ~~minimal~~ code creates a window and draws a static triangle in the center. The triangle is drawn using simple trigonometric calculations to position its vertices equidistant from the center point.

```c
#include "levegl/levegl.h"

int main( void )
{
    // Set up window
    const int width = 480;
    const int height = 272;

    InitWindow( width, height, "LeveGL Triangle" );
    SetTargetFPS( 60 );

    // Calculate fixed triangle points
    float cx = width / 2.0F;
    float cy = height / 2.0F;
    float r = 100.0F;

    // Points for an upward-facing triangle
    float x1 = cx;                        // Top point
    float y1 = cy - r;
    float x2 = cx - r * 0.866F;           // Bottom left (cos(120¬∞))
    float y2 = cy + r * 0.5F;             // Bottom left (sin(120¬∞))
    float x3 = cx + r * 0.866F;           // Bottom right (cos(240¬∞))
    float y3 = cy + r * 0.5F;             // Bottom right (sin(240¬∞))

    // Main loop
    while( !ShouldQuit() )
    {
	// Draw triangle
	BeginDrawing();
        {
		ClearBackground( WHITE );
		DrawTriangle( (int)x1, (int)y1, (int)x2, (int)y2, (int)x3, (int)y3, BLACK );
	}
        EndDrawing();
    }

    // Close window and clean up resources before exiting
    CloseWindow();

    return 0;
}
```

## Build & Run

##### CPM.cmake

1. First, set up [CPM.cmake] in your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p cmake
   wget -O cmake/CPM.cmake https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/releases/latest/download/get_cpm.cmake
   ```

2. In your `CMakeLists.txt`, add the following lines after `project(...)`:

   ```cmake
   include(cmake/CPM.cmake)

   CPMAddPackage("gh:SOHNE/LeveGL@0.0.1")

   add_executable(your_target main.cpp)
   target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE LeveGL::LeveGL)

## Roadmap

- [ ] Design and implement an OpenGL Abstraction Layer
- [ ] Font rendering system
- [ ] 3D shapes and models
- [ ] Dedicated documentation page
